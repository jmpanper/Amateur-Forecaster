Amateur Weather Forecaster
==========================
  This project was developed in order to understand Javascript and how to connect to different APIs. Its main feature is you can know the weather based on your geolocalization. 
  It's a simple project I try to improve every now and then, making efforts to improve its content and style, to be more appealing to its users
  The technologies used are HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The API used is weatherAPI since it offers real-time weather at no cost and highly scalable features.

  Icons were difficult to set up at first, since weatherAPI didn't send them correctly. 
    - In order to solve this issue I save the icons used as assets, casting the icon file which should be returned by the API. Then the icon is found in the assets folder of the project with the same name.


Issues:
  - There is currently a problem with the API call. Since it's an HTTP call instead of HTTPS Github pages don't let me do the call.
